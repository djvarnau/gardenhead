        <h2>The Gardenhead Story</h2>
        <p>Gardenhead was founded by Dan Varnau and Amanda Larkin in the fall of 2013.  They started brewing from pre-made kits in their stupid tiny kitchen in their house in the ghetto of Broadripple, Indiana.  They eventually moved on to creating their own recipes and in 2016, after getting over a million dollars from their wedding, decided to make the jump to a full-fledged brewery.
<br>
<br>
The brewery opened with just a half-barrel production.  In 2018, Varnau's brother, Tyler, was hired on as head brewer and production was increased to two barrels.  Later that year, Gardenhead expanded to include a taproom which hosts twelve different taps, including Gardenhead beers brewed on site as well as other local and national beers.  Since opening in 2016, Gardenhead's production capacity has increased by 500%.  Their beers can be found in most liquor stores in the midwest. </p>
